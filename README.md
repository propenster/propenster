### Hi there, Welcome to Propenster's Github Profile :+1:

##### System.out.Console.WriteLine.echo.print("Goodbye Dlrow"); ðŸ˜„

Faith Olusegun is a cool software developer who is on fire... I convert coffee into code... You can find me here - [Github](https://github.com/propenster).



I love people who are given to self-development and people that seek mentoring from other developers. :octocat:


I am building a startup - [WagLister](https://github.com/propenster/WagLister) which I've been so busy to focus on nowadays but I'll finish it.... :sparkles: 


If I'm not fooling around with [Python](https://python.org) using [Django Framework](https://djangoproject.com) and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), I am probably writing [Java](https://java.com), or what I do daily now, building minimalistic FinTech RESTful APIs with C# and ASP.NET Core. I am also obsessed with creating my database using scripts (rather than GUIs). I love Stored Procedures - Thanks to my boss who exposed me to them. :+1:

I also volunteer with Companies that use [PHP/Laravel](https://laravel.com) when I'm not busy with my permanent work - weekends.

I love open source and I must also say that I eat bugs for breakfast...
