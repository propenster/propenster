### Hi there, Welcome to propenster's Github Profile :+1:

##### System.out.Console.WriteLine.echo.print("Goodbye Dlrow"); ðŸ˜„

Faith Olusegun is a software developer... I convert coffee into code... You can find me here - [Github](https://github.com/propenster).

I write code, engineer software and application programming interfaces (APIS) that connect several financial institutions, tech companies and government institutions together.


I am self-motivated and determined. I also love to seek mentoring from other engineers. :octocat:

I write a lot [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code joyfully and opensourcefully at an unstoppable pace. To currently pay bills (this may change in the future), I use [Java](https://java.com), [C# and ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core) and TypeScript to build Enterprise software solutions. :+1:

I love open source, I collaborate with other link minds to make our world a better place. I eat bugs for breakfast... 

I use tabs not spaces except if I'm on VIM :+1:
