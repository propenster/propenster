### Hi there, Welcome to Propenster's Github Profile :+1:

##### System.out.Console.WriteLine.echo.print("Goodbye Dlrow"); ðŸ˜„

Faith Olusegun is a software developer... I convert coffee into code... You can find me here - [Github](https://github.com/propenster).

I write code, engineer softwares and application programming interfaces (APIS) that connect several financial institutions, tech companies together.



I am self-motivated and determined. I also love to seek mentoring from other engineers. :octocat:

I write a lot [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code. Also, If I'm not fooling around with [Python](https://python.org) using [Django Framework](https://djangoproject.com) and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), I am probably writing [Java](https://java.com), or what I get paid to do daily now, building Enterprise-scale FinTech RESTful APIs with [C# and ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core). I am also obsessed with creating my database using scripts (rather than GUIs). :+1:

I love open source and I must also say that I eat bugs for breakfast... 

- ðŸ”­ I like randomly working on unfinished startup projects [WagLister](https://github.com/propenster/WagLister) and [Tikki](https://github.com/propenster/Tikki) :+1:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently Building Fluent API's with ASP.NET Core, Heavy FinTech APIS, REST and SOAP WebServices for companies whose valuation are in 8 figures USD...
