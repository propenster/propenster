### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**propenster/propenster** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Faith Olusegun is a cool software developer who is on fire... I convert coffee into code... You can find me here - [Github](https://github.com/propenster).

I love people who are given to self-development and people that seek mentoring from other developers.

I am building a startup - [WagLister](https://github.com/propenster/WagLister) which I've been so busy to focus on nowadays but I'll finish it....

If I'm not fooling around with [Python](https://python.org) using [Django Framework](https://djangoproject.com) and Django REST Framework, I am probably writing Java, or what I do daily now, building minimalistic FinTech RESTful APIs with C# and ASP.NET Core. I am also obsessed with creating my database using scripts (rather than GUIs). I love Stored Procedures - Thanks to my boss who exposed me to them.

I love open source. I eat bugs for breakfast..
